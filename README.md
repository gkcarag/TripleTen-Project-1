# TripleTen-Project-1
# In this project, we are analyzing a dataset containing vehicle information, such as manufacturer, model, year, condition, etc. and visualizing the data using plotly tools to display patterns and group data. Using streamlit, we can turn the python script into a web application that displays our data.

# In order to launch locally, you must first install Anaconda to your system. 
# Then install the github repository into your local files.
# Enter 'conda base activate' to enable python environment.
# Then, run 'streamlit run app.py' to view page locally.
